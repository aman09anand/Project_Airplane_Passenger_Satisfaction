Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

Prepare a model for customer satisfaction rate (last column) after 
a) removing unnecessary paramters.
Steps After removing unnecessary parameters:
0) Find any missing values, and outliers if any in the continuous field
1) Build a model using all the fields (doing appropriate conversions)
1a) Logistic Regression
1b) Decision Tree,
1c) Randomforest
1d) Naive Bayes
1e) AdaBoost, GDBoost, XGBoost
2) Find fields that are dependent using chi square (for categorical variables)
3) Address multi-collinearity and build logistic regression models for them
